# Automatic-Liver-Segmentation-using-UNet-Architecture

This project employs the UNet architecture to automatically segment liver regions in medical images. 

Leveraging TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, it preprocesses images, trains the model, and evaluates segmentation accuracy. Dataset sources include medical imaging repositories with annotated liver images. 

Future enhancements may include advanced augmentation techniques, extension to other organs, and user-friendly interface development.
